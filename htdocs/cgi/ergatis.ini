[authentication]
;; OPTIONAL
;; how do you want permissions to be handled in Ergatis?  here are the available options.

;; ergatis executes pipelines as the user running the webserver.  
;;  options:
;;      open - logins not displayed. site completely open and anyone can run pipelines
;;             across all projects.
;;      kerberos - uses Kerberos to authenticate users.  this requires sudo privileges
;;             to be granted to the server user to sudo the 'RunWorkflow' or 'qsub RunWorkflow'
;;             commands as the user logged in

;; this next setting will only be used if authentication_method is not 'none'.  if requiring
;;  authentication, do you want Ergatis to sudo as the authenticated user before starting
;;  the pipeline?  this will ensure that the files created during the pipeline run are owned
;;  by the logged in user.  if you set this the sysadmin will need to grant passwordless
;;  sudo rights for the webserver owner to all authenticated users for only the following 
;;  two commands (these are examples, modify your paths appropriately):
;;      
;;      /usr/local/packages/workflow/RunWorkflow
;;      /usr/local/bin/qsub /usr/local/packages/workflow/RunWorkflow 
;;
;;  here is an example sudo entry the sysadmin needs to create
;;
;;      apache         luthor=(ALL,!#0) NOPASSWD:/local/scratch/workflow/scripts/*.sh
;;
;; where you replace /local/scratch/workflow with the value you defined above for the
;;  workflow_run_dir variable.  You should take special care to ensure that this directory
;;  has 755 permissions so noone but the web server user can write to it.  Change 'apache'
;;  above to the user your web server is running as.  Also, you must comment out this line from
