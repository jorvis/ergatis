[parameters copydb]
;; This copydb workflow will copy the database (data in tables) associated to this project to another chado database.
;; It is assumed that the two chado databases were instantiated with the same version of the chado database schema.
;; 
;; Note: Both databases will be backed up to the file system.
;;
;; To receive email notification if WARN, ERROR or FATAL messages were detected in any of the log4perl log files by check_logfiles.pl
;; Provide a comma-separated list of email accounts:
$;EMAIL$;     =
;; Name of the Sybase server on which this project's database resides
$;SERVER1$;   = 
;; Name of the Sybase server onto which this project's database should be copied into
$;SERVER2$;   = 
;; Name of the database into which database should be copied to

;; BCP .out file output directory for the target database
